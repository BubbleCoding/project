it's not an officially licensed product but um gets of my own division so I called Cadmus okay that seems obvious oh is that like playing odd job yeah it's a yes she has a she's very tiny she's very hard to hit let's uh I mean let's talk about our DD experience because I think we're all pretty uncomfortable right now um she played some fourth edition right yes I played fourth edition and only for the addition by played it I don't know I I didn't have a regular game like I've been played a lot but I've played um I don't know six or seven times Jesus what we just died maybe you're not ready for this maybe you're not ready for the D&amp;D acumen that I am played one time twice okay so this is two times then I've never played in my entire life you're the biggest goddamn nerd I've ever know I know and how did this happen I don't know you wasn't something you actively avoided cuz that's what I did for a while well yeah I just wasn't willing to take that step I just never had anybody who was interested in it besides me but you like came up in the Gygax era oh yeah you were in that actually met Gygax did you really yeah it's a con [ __ ] awkward conversation so what's your thing again dragon that sounds really good can't wait to play it Gary I know of those ideas separate in keep plugging at it Gare you know here get there keep it up with your role-playing James I think there were a lot of people didn't send dragons was the last bastion of nerd them the nerdiest thing you could do yeah and it was sort of like the failsafe like emergency light at least I don't play Dungeons &amp; Dragons but the good thing is now LARPing is a thing so yes we can air we can say like some day there will be like um like live-action slash fiction hmm and then LARPing will be like passe and then we can finally finally finally Royal Doulton we're getting there with the quest on ABC so I yeah it's true Travis I need you to I did you claim is your dog playing my adventure she is princess butter she's she's playing as my my dyer hound lady okay try I will we do all have a Dyer hound in and if and when I decide that you've earned one do you remember how when you got Nessie you had to like do chores and stuff to show you're responsible enough I will give you a fake in-game dog but you have to show me that you can take care of it and you can feed it and take I rolled my own character and I wrote him a backstory that's your this is sir for the right direction Matt but I named I have a name so well well let's talk about the classes we're playing sera I play with three people which is the I knee it's pitiful based we're gonna get you all demolished yeah you're gonna get wrecked I'll be dungeon mastering which I've never done I actually did it once for on a pickup game what am I telling to never honor three people it's try me sir but but you you guys will be facing the horrors that I throw at you and you'll be playing I think we're keeping a pretty traditional yeah yeah we got a Travis you're gonna be a fighter I'm playing a human fighter named Magnus Burnside's I love that Magnus Burnside's correct you see you see I mean Magnus is that is that greco-roman in nature is he is he real historical fantasy what's the deal yes Magnus burns eyes it's a real person that I based this on okay I'm I'm playing a wizard okay his name is spelled taa ko so liked a take away take it tot well I mean that it's it is your wizard named are you naming your goddamn wizard taco taco it's a fairly name it's not pronounced lesser for something he's actually taco the lesser my father talk of the great taco supreme please please gonna be Taco Bell I live in a Cabana I guess it's okay Justin because like in the in the in the infinite world of fantasy I'm about to cry for you maybe tacos don't exist already and it's just in the Trish of the traditional oh my god the title goals not realize my goal this adventure is to invent it's sure for salsa you might United you're all for salsa I don't know you can take any number of checks it can take a peppers check a sauce check zesty check a soft or hard shell check I love a check I'm going to be so deep in game their names I'm gonna be ridiculous what is it not go roll free zestiness roll for going and thinking outside the bun daddy what do you uh your classmate I'm a dwarf cleric okay named Merle hi Church Merle that's ERL II see that's a goddamn name put it yeah Magnus Burnside Magnus is a great name I'm saying all three I say we're batting a thousand here with Justin what was your race taco white no it does actually matter and for their statistical implicit high elf I'm a high elf Oh God terrific do you have a last name taco supreme the wizard no taco again but spelled differently DAC I do have a last name but it's a secret that will only be revealed later that's power Merl taco and Magnus it sounds like the league on FX no it's fantastic so uh thank you for plugging our FX sponsorship yeah I was surprised that they would step in to support us to give us that trust before even started but cool so so these three sheets here Travis I know you went off-book to do your own thing to get core I love the game Griffin I guess somebody checking your math as we play he is invincible and it's he I rolled 20 somehow okay so so he's level 20 everything's 20s across the bowl I see he can't roll below a 20 he camera below ice just a plus 20s on all of his skill check interesting and he has a magic sword that kills people in one hit okay but the only fire hound the only thing is is that he's got a disease that will kill him in 15 that is threat he's too beautiful he's too perfect to live his his face is just one more hand you would think that would factor into his name but no no well because the others didn't know he was gonna have one more hand prophase than he was born as something it about I wrote a whole back three about why he has a face for her face does he have sideburns no full beard but Burnside but the sideburns are twice as bushy is the rest of the beer that's a weird look well he started to have sideburns and then he just stopped okay not I mean anybody didn't trim them down he let it grow out I understand but he does care he carries a vanity mirror with him because Sunday he will decide to just take it back to the sideburns and he wants to be ready I understand so Magnus I assume is like ready to roll I assume I'll be checking your math as we go along for any yes I I believe I have I have caught everything and I'm ready to go okay you want to give us like a brief overview of what he's all about so he's he's a protection style fighter okay which means that he gets he gets +2 while carrying a shield okay now I have to do two AC which allows the fighter to oh it here it is protection style fighting allows the fighter to impose this advantage on an enemy attacking you or a target within five feet okay if you are using a melee weapon and a shield okay I can explain what all those words meant dad and Justin probably and Travis okay I should point out that we're playing fifth edition which the starter kit is out for the players how about handbook isn't out so we're all kind of learning this together all at the same time so I can explain some of those concepts to you as you go along but that's basically you stand in the way of [ __ ] and you know how people not get hit I also come my background is that of a carpenter um who has become a folk hero and one of my special abilities is called you built you built a tight chair once yeah you built the chair once in the whole village came in I built an army out of wood I have a special skill called rustic hospitality which means Burnside estate and the rustic hospitality means that because I come from the ranks of common folk you fit among them with ease you can find a place to hide rest or recuperate among other commoners unless you have shown yourself to be a danger to them they shield you from the law or anyone else searching for you though they are unwilling to risk their lives for you so poor people love Magnus that's why yes it's correct he's alaria the Cable Guy of Martina he's the Cheetos of people listen I reach out to real America yeah and real America loves Magnus well real real faerûn or Ferg all fires are worth like a real down-home favor in there a couple other special things my flaw is that the tyrant that I've stopped will stop at nothing to see my end oh sure I believe in fairness no one is above the law yeah yeah and if someone is in trouble I will stop at nothing to help them and thinking is for other people I'm all about action ok your your lawful I'm assuming lawful good lawful is it ok sounds good cool yeah you some you some pretty set up so let's move on to Justin because you I think have the next in order of experience because you played once because you played once which is infinity times more than dad zero right I'm actually mathematically speaking that would still be zero hey hey shut up old man um we're playing silent god I love you so we're playing games not maths I got tacos wizard yeah I got spell casting abilities you didn't even I mean that was redundant too I assume that your wizard was capable of I can I have a book that I can look at to get to just relax a little bit and just get back in my in my zone what's the book is it the secret what no it's a book that I carry around with me through the seven Habits of Highly Effective People needs a minute it's a record of my life's work so far the seven Habits of Highly Effective Elves and I get around with me and it helps me can I ask one or two of the habits I imagine looking at trees as well yeah long hair there's one your flaxen do okay thank you Saget don't forget hacky sack is that flavor or does that have does that have a mechanical context it does have a mechanical effect I can I can rest once per day and recover expended spell slots okay so with a combined level equal to or less than half of my level so spell slots is a sort of a new concept well I mean it's it's an ancient old concept that they sort of brought back for fifth edition and and dad it applies to you too as a cleric both of you have a type of spell called can trips and you can basically use those whenever they they some of them may carry a resource or component cost but I'm not really concerned with maintaining that element of the role-playing because I don't want to give you guys like in-game fake shopping lists for bat wings and [ __ ] so these can trips you can do whenever you want as many times as you want per day so Justin tacos should have a few written down there I don't know if you want to go shopping around in the guide to switch those out I do some comparison shopping to find this buzz they're right for you there's some solid ones in there already mage hand it's basically telekinesis essentially in picks it up and move it around from a distance prestidigitation is sort of distracting spells minor or you start with you have fork and trips and they're listed in that box sort of in the middle there of your of your character sheet okay you've also got ray of frost which is the one you'll most commonly use in combat probably it's a damaging ray of frost that you use to hurt and slow it I have to first level spell slots that I can use to cast my prepared spells right so so aside from your can trips if you're gonna use at will at any time you have this concept of spell slots so of your list of spells that you have memorized which if you look down at the spell book part of that box juice they actually have picks them out for you already perfect which again if okay yeah no they're good they're their magic missile you got magic missile you got shield which can protect you in a pinch you got Metis charmer leaves having a hard time catching some Z's you guys sleep if you if your doctor refuses to to refill your ambien prescription hey that's not funny I suppose it's not uh you got burning hands you got the hits right but to use those you'll have to expend a first-level spell slot because they are first level spells but you can only use them once you : oh well now you can use each individual spell as any as many times as you want but each time you do you burn one of those spell slots so you have to first level spell slots and when you use one of those spell slots you burn one of those up and then you can use one other thing from that first level list and then that will use another spell slot and with your recovery you can recover those on a short rest which is any rest that takes like an hour basically you can do that between fights you drink a capri-sun just like eat a PowerBar eat a PowerBar eat a Luna Bar get your electrolytes so right and then you want a short rest you can do whatever on a long rest you basically start back from zero you get all your spell slots back use so I've also can see in the dark oh you have dark vision yeah I'm seeing the dark just like it's a bright light I can always see shades of grey though ain't that the whale shades I could have an advantage of saving throws against being charmed okay and magic can't put me to sleep except that's what a curse you can't use your own sleeping spell on yourself look at those good Z's maybe taking a trip tomorrow actually elves don't sleep Griffin you should know that they meditate deeply fantastic yeah and I got a shelter the fateful so I'm a servant of omec not I command that respect of those who share my faith and I can perform the rites of omec and you and your companions that's you guys can expect to receive free healing and care at a temple shrine or other established presence of omics face i like the way that they phrase that like you can expect together roll em die you're really dying to like actually play so i should point out that your your divine patron is is called agna not Olmec he's like an actual guy he's the god of knowledge national Geiger how deep in are you for the game pretty deep in dropping you're a wizard I was confused by this at first because you're a wizard which you typically don't think of him as especially about people but this is a God of wizardly [ __ ] and so maybe that is it's also important to keep in mind that where my background is full cure his background is acolyte why he was a member of a temple a temple dedicated to getting better a wizard [ __ ] which makes sense I so what's all your what's all your [ __ ] the personality traits and ideals and bonds and flaws are pre-written and I don't want you to feel like you have to use the stuff that came at the box I figure a lot of that stuff is gonna we're gonna figure that out as we go merge yeah alright dad go Merle is a I'm sorry I am a number of de Worf Merle is a he'll dwarf neutral good used to be a soldier he was a mercenary soldier okay but the life was just too hard on him comes from a big family and all with names like none drew rocks seeker yeh hundred garden he was not asked to go along with the dwarves in any of the Hobbit movies and he's kind of pissed about that mm-hmm cleric is a domain is affiliated with Marham or twin oh [ __ ] Worf God of Wanderers travelers and outcasts dad the interesting stuff was on the front of the base oh sorry ah let's see he's a lot of fun to parties he's a good dancer is that smart is this makes you want to talk about yourself what is this party skill how hard does he party you may not have these tea parties like it's 1999 he has 1999 party points what is a party point why do we need to play a party point dad already won Dungeons &amp; Dragons with his pre-rolled broken character I got trapped on who is sort of sorted coins in a jar I'm sorting out my dollies Jesus you're gonna head in the game a little bit so so dad as the cleric you are you are the feeling you are going to be healing but if you look at stuff like Travis you I do it's like you've made him a rocker I put them in a glass mug which in retrospect um that's bad podcaster yeah it's just one on one bad town oh Jesus look I'm still dad you have a pretty high armor class which makes you pretty hearty you also have a Warhammer that can deal a lot of damage so you're not this frail weeping weeping shrinking what's the phrase shrinking violet you're not that oh you can get in you can get into the [ __ ] and imagine that you will um I just like when I was in Nam you also have kin trips like Justin that you can use that will without burning through anything you have light which cast a light on things you have sacred flame which is sort of a ranged attack spell you have thaumaturgy I think I'm saying that right which can be used to shut or open a door for example it has a lot of different implications here's what sucks is they have not picked out your spells for you like they did for Justin I guess they knew that you hadn't played before and they wanted to make this as hard on us as these humans I actually have a couple of mine now I I picked two two pre-prepared so as I will say as a disciple of life which is every cleric has like a specialization yours is the live tree which is basically healing it's about being Hardy that is why you have this heavy armor specialization is because you are a disciple of life basically a disciple of not dying so as a disciple of life you automatically have bless and cure wounds you already have those memorized you don't have to spend your time memorizing those you've got those in the bag basically okay so if I do I need to tell you right now the two I do want to load up you-you-you can have you have four prepared right and then when you use one of them it uses up one of your spell slots but you don't have to pick the two way way in advance all right okay um so then I think we're I think we're more or less good to go um I guess it's just sort of an overview of how Dungeons &amp; Dragons works because dad you've you're literally starting from scratch here um you can see all over your sheet you have different mire modifiers different numbers different stats the basic mechanic of Dungeons &amp; Dragons is you say what you want to do if it's something like I'm going to attack that person that's pretty easy you just roll your 20-sided die and then you add a relevant modifier to it and if it beats their armor you hit them that is that's sort of the basic idea of Dungeons &amp; Dragons if you want to get more creative with it then there are rules in place that will help me sort of interpret your action and make it something that happens in the game but almost always it's gonna be roll a d20 you add a modifier to it and then if it beats a target then you you can you can do it and you did it and I'm proud of you thank you the only other big thing and it's new for fifth edition is the idea of advantage and disadvantage which can be conferred in any number of situations maybe Justin helps Travis or sorry taco helps Magnus hapis I almost feel like your name is gonna be hard to remember next to taco it's a little stick because I wasn't creative enough that's calling Maggie Mack Mack so Justin you taco could help Maggie um with a shot he could restrain an enemy that would give Magnus an advantage on his attack that means you roll to d20 instead of one and you get to keep the higher result um so like a special power I'd use I mean no it is a mechanic that can be used in any number of situations if you get a surprise attack on an enemy maybe you jump out of the branches of a tree and attack them from above I would like ink I could choose if you're well that's that I guess has gone by the way so really but yeah if you do sweet [ __ ] and I feel like it I'll give you advantage on the attack maybe you're bound maybe you can't see an enemy so good because you got mud in your eye it doesn't all have to be about mud that's just where I'm at right now you will have disadvantage on the attack which is the same idea you roll two dice but you have to take the lower result interesting which is bad you you rarely want that you know I've got a question yeah please I don't have any spells do I have any like special attacks so let's talk about that because you're coming from fourth edition and in fourth edition everybody had powers right uh-huh the idea was powers you had at will powers you could use at any time you had encounter powers which we could use once per fight it's the only parts you use once per day everybody had that and they were basically everybody was a wizard right mm-hmm like everybody had abilities that I can shout at you really loud far away and it does 2d6 damage so like that idea is is gone the rules as they stand now are getting back more to the idea of playing your class so as a fighter you are gonna get [ __ ] super good at fighting you are going to be able to fight and in a melee contest a lot better than these other two chumps here so that's why my attack bonus is so high like I +5 to attack ya on all this [ __ ] it's another question there's a little box with this equipment is that the stuff that I have right now yeah you have those things okay did you not like your equipment you need no it's all fine there's nothing about closed in here but I figure I have them no you're actually common clothes at the bottom no sorry I'm taking that away from you now Oh dragon comes and bites all your clothes off hi my hello my name is taka and this is my dick can I come in your town I could save it oh I can save it from goblins and stuff um yeah no you have that so basically if you look on the back of your sheet it'll sort of tell you how your characters can develop through the first five levels which is really all the starter kit covers fighter for instance is going to get healing surge which is something that everybody had in fourth edition in this edition only fighters get it basically it allows you to heal yourself in battle yeah also a corner on the sheet that's on the sheet that's that's just what Travis kids as a wizard you're gonna unlock more powerful spells you're gonna unlock more spell slots so you can use your stronger spells more frequently in combat okay and and everybody gets some cool stuff but it's not regimented like powers it's not like regimented here is a thing that you will be able to use once in a battle and it's gonna create like a square of fire or something it's it's the rules of fifth edition are a lot more about improvising they're all about like letting you guys roleplay and come up with clever situation solutions to challenging situations because we're fourth edition was more like a war game like a tactics game right fifth edition is very old-school in this sense that if you just tackle problems by attacking them by getting in fights every time you see enemies and just like rushing headed you're gonna die because like you think about it realistically if you fight everything you see then you're gonna get this [ __ ] kicked out of you you're gonna be fighting as things that are gonna be stronger than you one of you will probably die at some point um wait wait wait why I'm saying this is this is very old-school D&amp;D or like your character is is very vulnerable and there's a lot of things I'm not gonna like pull any punches because frankly I think it's more entertaining when bad things do happen to you so you have to be smart and you have to come up with clever stuff there's a there's a resource called inspiration that is not actually on your character sheet they may face that out of the game but it's in the the basic rules online that basically if any of you role play good or comes up with a clever solution to a situation that works for you I can give you inspiration which you can then spend to give yourself advantage on any role so okay if you to think outside the box I will definitely reward but but try to think outside the box within the context of what your character sure would you write um which is a lot you have a lot more freedom and in fourth edition what your character could do is basically what's printed on these cards that somebody print it out for you um that sounds more up my alley well now we got to be creative now now you're gonna love it I bet okay I don't know I've never played this I don't really D in before I also I forgot to mention that I ruled for a trinket when creating my character oh boy and so I have a knife that belonged to a relative like a mutter knife it's like a pocket knife it's like a a Swiss Army knife it's got a toothpick in it it's like a +8 knife that you're not actually what you when you make your character you can roll once all the trinkets able to gain a trinket a simple item lightly touched by mr. now it's not lightly touched by killer magic though no I don't know I don't think I'm my thing has any magic in it well thanks for stopping the podcast to let us know that your shitty he's gonna come back into play I think if we build the story and the character honey my tiny knife will come into service sell it to pawn his people's life to buy out of jail [ __ ] skeleton rips your arms off you're not gonna be like but then a dragon comes out of a knife and it was there the whole time and he loves me that's not myself people alright alright this is this game are you guys ready yeah this is the game we won I'm gonna take you all into the infinite [ __ ] a magistrate here are you ready I'm nervous like I'm I'm not psyched about like saying things like Neverwinter and gun drill rock seeker when you took it Fred hold on one moment I'm gonna grab a bag of chips [ __ ] Oh for something Manzano I go and then play with you you're not gonna eat chips while we he's already gone he's gonna get some chips to act like this oh great so Griffin how are you pretty good you nervous dad you've never know I got nothing to lose here I mean everybody knows that I have absolutely no skill in this game and so I can come in and everybody says oh poor old man you know this is you know we're playing with we're in the demons domain right now right this is this is this is Satan's territory it's ain't war I will draw upon my years of reading doorstopper fantasy books and yeah III honestly believe that dad went through the best one of this game I mean still you got a roll of dice and not blow it yeah it's really hard to like give skill at rolling a dice better Travis I've just realized I can't see what dice to roll I assume that dad and Justin are gonna keep each other on it why would I lie because you're you don't lie because honestly it's so great when you guys [ __ ] up I don't know I won't lie I'm back and I made no baek's I just got to decide what dice to roll I have like six different dice sets and I have no bakes do when I give us a quick review mm-hmm they have a certain a certain quality to them that makes you think of wintertime and and hugs god damn that should be the aim in this all right wish you I wish you knew anything about this do this responsibility for I just saying I wanna have fun I don't know I knew Griffin I'm just saying I'm not gonna have fun playing daddy well that's all sounds like a good way to start cool um so if you guys step any mattress for your here okay no it's hovering so so our story actually starts with the three of you and you guys can establish if you want how magnus and taco and merle know each other make Craigslist a crazy actually which is actually a list of a node named craig tree every day so you find each other on Craigslist maybe you've been doing some odd jobs around the economies in the shader and you have a hard time doing work that does not involve goblins and or skeletons Travis your Karpin jury is nobody wants chairs nowadays people are more into iron wrought things you know irons gonna go out yeah and draw the fashion people move back into wicker Bronze Age is gonna in some time right and then it's gonna get retro back into wood so the three of you have done a few jobs together probably over drinks one night with with Murrells cousin whose name is [ __ ] his name is Gunter and Rock seeker who I assumed is just name that so you know from the start here that we are now playing dungeon his name is Steve Smith his name these names are out of control I may eventually shed the booklet I'm going out of which I'm really hoping you guys didn't read because I bought all of you starter kits and you could have just cheated and read ahead misadventure Gunjan Rock seeker comes to you guys in a bar maybe had a few drinks maybe not I don't want to make assumptions maybe maybe you're all straightedge maybe you don't like Thai yeah magnus has had about six ciders six but he know he can hold his own pretty weak as sliders go and like 3.2 we know that merle possesses nearly two thousand party points so yes I imagine he's been crushing he's the Andrew W K of D&amp;D you're right over cider he dusts you guys about an exciting opportunity he seems pretty straight-laced he seems like he's not giving you no [ __ ] and he promises it in a low dwarven grumble which I'm not going to do that do it or I'll walk Griffin it's not fun if you don't do the voice he says he he says no that's just that's how he sounds you were interpreting these low grunt basically blighters we're gonna go wreck him for rock you interpret from his Slingblade esque grunts that he has to offer you what he calls the last job you'll ever need to take which you take at face value to mean riches and not that you'll die not that he'll be murdered on this journey but first he wants to know maybe he's doing it as a favor to you Merle maybe he knows that you've had some hard times lately and religion business is not good no people are not crazy about fantasy Jesus I forget who's your who's your god oh that would be Mart hammered win I'm just gonna go with Twiggy's for Jesus but before he will let you into this exciting opportunity that you tried to press him on and he refuse to tell you any more about he basically wants to audition you to see if you are capable of handling says it's like a two contrasting monologues or yeah he wants he wants one that she was excitement when it shows impotent rage no he wants it had a two-minute song he was thinking more along the lines of slaying protecting guidance adventuring essentially cinnamon so he has asked the three of you to escort a supply wagon from the the town of Neverwinter where the three of you are currently held up to the town of FanDuel in which none of you have actually been to but maybe you know a thing or two about it if you want you can make a history check to see if you know anything about it and since this is your first check I guess I'll explain how that works if you look on your sheet you'll see history stat there and the scale so you roll yourself a d20 and mine is plus zero because I'm not very intelligent it's actually a wisdom based roll so what you basically what basically all those mean yeah history is a wisdom no I'm sorry that is intellect you're right can I roll everybody can roll sure I got a 12 I got an 18 18 raw yeah dad you want to Myrlie want to give it a shot I got a 9 you rolled a 9 or with your modifier 0 this is our first roll our fan of this magical fantasy world that we're basically using it to [ __ ] MapQuest something about fall ad win it's fan delin whatever you might guys might want to get some note by Road around Oh fantastic um so did dad so Travis you know given that you're pretty goddamn dumb thank you you still know which the other two should be ashamed they couldn't pull this out that FanDuel in' is an old mining town that used to be very very prosperous they had a very productive mother lode operation going on but the town was ransacked by we know what they were mining uh actually they were mining magical ores they found a deep magical vein within the earth and sort of the creation of magical items and the the the mining of ores that could be used inside those items sort of turned it into a extremely profitable town very very quickly but it was basically destroyed by a wave of orcs that swept over the land it's on the up-and-up now it's sort of being that the vein is still there right the vein is the long since been lost this was long ago they don't have that that economy anymore but the town is being rebuilt by enterprising individuals it's more rugged imagine like Deadwood but shittier shittier than Deadwood which already wasn't super great and guns ran the name of that town one more time Randall and FanDuel and family thing Gendron seems to have a vested interest him and his family his immediate family Merle you aren't so involved in FanDuel ends reconstruction but gun Drance seems very invested in that town and it's gross so he has asked you to basically bring a supply run from Neverwinter to FanDuel and it's about a two three day ride on a on a wagon as the expecting trouble uh no not really if he's gonna get it well you you don't know he's giving us up he's giving you a job right was about Merle he has asked you basically to transport a wagon full of goods maybe if you have his personal effects from Neverwinter to FanDuel in' and it sounds like a pretty easy job but you never know he's asking question yeah please is this entire adventure dictated through exposition or no we're gonna get out this is this a stage set is this a game is dungeon dragons listening to you do exposition no not for the most part okay I got it this is me planting this seed I've actually planted the seed and I have to plan it cover it in soil and nurture it for a bit and then it's gonna I'm just gonna blow on it and that's it okay you know Justin from my limited amount what always makes D&amp;D better is questioning how long it's take yeah he has offered you a ten gold pieces a piece each yes that's which I mean I'm not your boss but that's not a lot of money but hey is he open to negotiation can I roll for intimidation to see or you could pass I thought I thought we weren't playing yet this actually did happen in the past yeah no payment on arrival maybe you can try and negotiate but yeah he has offered he you do this supply run the payments not great but the promise that you'd the last job you'll ever need to do certainly did it for you so gotcha you are now you're all on the road this is where we find our heroes right now am i driving the cart because I actually I have a proficiency in vehicles do you really I do okay you can be driving the car so we can say that it's basically like a covered Conestoga wagon covered by a canvas tarp over it and led by two oxen that did did he give us a map you have a map yeah do we know how long override it is it'll be about two days okay there's a lot of like game [ __ ] about about having to stop and forage and how much money are you spending on food and but I hate all that stuff not only is he is he along with us so Jun dreama is actually gonna pet you guys okay with a a fighter escort named SIL dar hall winter whom you've never met he was not actually at the tavern laughing sure he was dead at the Wine Mixer for you guys and his name one more time SIL dar hall winter Sun yeah it sounds disgust air he's gonna call him silly very blue jeans I can call it there and saying this is our game we can do what everyone I can start calling these creeps very blue jeans and you're good okay okay all winter does not stick in my head but very blue jeans all never okay look Barry blue jeans today that's his name now so when you say they're up ahead like a day ahead on yards ahead left that night you guys are taking off in the morning better half day ahead he's very excited to get there so he bounced he took off did I bring the ingredients to create what people there's a problem there's no cultured milk at this point in the world have a hard time with uh with a sour cream all right once you can crack that [ __ ] riddle man I'll give it to you I will shower you with riches as the taco bag Nate okay add lactose-intolerant did we bring food yes don't you have food don't worry about it okay um we eat the oxen you eat the oxen no I don't do that um I'm a it's funny you guys are traveling with a lot of general store Goods who maybe a bunch of parcels of light leather armor some tiny almost like blasting caps like powder kegs are they are sure regis like hitching around they are what you're taking to a storefront in fan de lijn called barth ins provisions and upon receipt they will give you your payment but you got those we get some armors some blasting caps and food basically this the gig we're doing for 10 gold apiece yeah drop it off some supplies while traveling with it and we arrived safely and we've got a that's we'll adventure and it's mm okay there's a small leather chest that you're traveling with that a belongs to gundrick also traveling with you is gundrum's pet dog who is a dire house oh it's sad well it's a bulldog tiny bulldog not doesn't look especially threatening doesn't look scrappy sorry Travis it's the ugliest dog you've ever seen space two butts with some light in the middle there it's basically butts all over like reverse cat bones yeah it has been pretty tame on your journey sleeping most of the time among the provisions but yeah the Bulldog have a name the bulldogs name is Ruby just made that up got it you're such a good DM thank you the dog's name is Ruby so you have a lot of stuff that you are traveling with you so much so that you couldn't really take it and get out and walk but that doesn't matter because you have this oxen led wagon you can establish where you guys are on this wagon maybe one of you is keeping a look at from the rear maybe one of you is riding on top like team or I'm in the I'm in the back with the goods okay then I'm driving are you getting high in you in supplier you may be eaten an apple maybe even Apple you should be right yeah okay all right Travis you're driving the oxen yes you said look at my vehicle proficiency I'm driving quite well I don't know how to interpret vehicle proficient one is very impressed you're not gonna hit a [ __ ] ramp we gotta get away from Boss Hogg I'm the guy you are yeah Merle where are you what are you doing I am probably studying my cam trips okay and I think there's something up I guess I guess like why can't he do both like Annie masturbate and also cast ethereal light I don't see a role for that yeah roll to masturbate hey listen can I do things yet yeah so you guys have just made of the brunt of the journey about a day and a half after leaving Neverwinter you've basically turned off the high road that connects the major cities on the coast you taking the off-ramp that will lead you to FanDuel in' and things definitely are not as well maintained a lot of potholes I got a lot of great infrastructure so as you're traveling a few say about 30 40 miles out from fan delin I want you all to make a perception check which you can see the modifier there I will explain what this is for people who aren't listening basically all the skills have a defined role that's critical climate oh [ __ ] so you did very well a perception is a wisdom skill so you roll your wisdom modifier which is in that on the left and then if you are proficient in that skill which is if it has a little circle next to it that means you're just a little bit better at it so you add your proficiency bonus which is at the top of the page there and that factors into a lot of stuff spell casting attacking your proficiency bonus plays a hand in a lot of roles okay so I'm a total yeah and Merle Wow at six and twenty six twenty three twenty three okay you see this [ __ ] out of everything um Travis you see about two hundred feet up lying in the road two figures that with your incredible perception check you can actually tell with your eagle eyes that they are two dead horses lying in the middle of the road seems fine as as the driver of the wagon you can I guess yeah stop the wagon okay just brain to stop and I'm chewing motion silently to get the attention of Merle and taco and kind of pull them up towards the front of the wagon okay you have a few months there were you warned them that [ __ ] has gone south I'll use that same perception check you notice a few figures crouching in a a part of the shaded would you they seem to observe stuffs like are we in bright sunlight you know they have actually noticed you and two of them are charging your wagon as you speak so because you notice them they did not gonna surprise round on you which would have been very very bad but I do need to all of you to Hey so initiative father is the thing that you roll before a fight starts and it determines who goes win all right so you have this roll the night give me give me a second five well together you've I roll vibe Alton I roll the 14 so uh Travis got a five I actually have a ten all day anybody to get 14 - - oh I'm sorry - 113 dirt oh so you have a - okay and I will roll for the gore blunts here that are storming you I'm gonna start out with Gordon's cuz it seems a comfortable territory you guys are familiar with the concept of a goblin is my first time ever doing this all they rolled a critical miss so uh they are going to get last I see so dad and Justin so you guys know cuz we mentioned crits now twice if you roll a twenty a natural 20 it is the best you can do if you're doing doing it up if you do it in a fight you get to deal bonus damage essentially um we can do automatic weapon or your spell and you automatically hit if you roll a twenty you don't have to add anything to it if you roll over one that's a critical miss or a critical [ __ ] and that means you miss no matter what um and usually you like fall in a cow pie or something yeah it's there's always a cow pie I summon up a cow pie in front of you for you to fall into okay hysterically how many are there there are three two of them are rushing the group one is pretty heavily obscured by the brush probably about 40 feet out sort of between you and the horses laying in the middle of the road so yeah the goblins are getting they got pretty close before this fight started but they moved before anybody moves or takes any actions we will start at the top of the order which is dad Merle so if you look inside of the rule book that came with the starter kit I don't know if you have that in front of you or anything it has the list of actions you can do what's manner actions in combat page 10 yeah essentially on your turn the two basic things you can do are move which you can do up to your speed which is on your sheet there it typically in Indy fourth edition you had a game board where you can track position here it's not as important I kind of Funch fudge a lot of it um and I try to keep in mind like who is where and who's fighting whom so yeah you can take a movement up to your speed do I have to take a movement you do not know you can also take an action those actions might include attacking with one of the weapons you have casting one of your spell's be it a can trip or a first-level spell maybe you want to drop a sacred flame on one of these guys um you have a lot of other actions you can do other than just fighting you can try and grapple an enemy you can aid one of your teammates you can try and do another perception check to search the area for other dangers you can you can basically do anything and there will be a rule to interpret that idea I know what I want to do okay I want to where were you can I ask one quick question yeah yeah are we definitely sure that these are bad guys uh they have weapons drawn and are rushing at your cart would it spend like a turn if dad was like whoa whoa whoa Kemosabe you cool hey you cool I most of the time just kind of general rule of thumb when you're DM tells you to roll for initiative you're in combat you're in combat but but you you can as a free action you can speak because speaking is not does not take a faction there are a lot of things that can be considered free actions be it drawing your sword that doesn't take your action or else that would be shitty talking to somebody not in action sometimes using an object like maneuvering complicated like device we'll take an action it's kind of up to my discretion what does and doesn't take directions so if you want to if you want to you can also make an insight check for free to see if these guys mean business or not or you can talk to them they probably won't know the language you're speaking well I think what I'm gonna do is first I want to cast bless okay on on the members of the party um so as just to give you sort of explain what's going on you only have I think to spell slots so if use bless right now at the beginning of author slash was one of the ones that I have that I don't have to use a slot for no no bless means that that just means that you have it memorized so you didn't have to learn it but if you cast it you are going to eat up unless it's a can trip can trips don't you [ __ ] exactly so you could cast light over sacred flame or thaumaturgy sacred flame is really your combat can't trip if you wanted to do that it's not above or you can get no it is a debuff in a sense that you set their asses on fire alright that is yeah or you could run up to them and smash them with your Warhammer and we're still above them right cuz we're on the cart they're on the ground Travis you are sort of in the saddle driving the cart all three of you are sort of towards the front of the cart where Magnus summon you up to to warn you hey dead horses so you are all basically towards the front of the cart and can easily hop down it's not especially high up okay so there is not really a buff at this level that I can throw on you guys to help you in combat not without burning through one of your spell slots which I will out of character tell you these goblins probably don't merit the caution that got you're putting into it um what was the the bolt thing you told me about the thicker flame you have sacred flame sacred flame alright I will I hit him with a sacred flame sacred flame hopefully Dungeons and Dragons will come up with an application that will keep you from having to look up your spell's as you cast them so sacred flame you cast upon one creature that you can see it's got a range of 60 feet which is you got it you're looking at the front of the wagon so you can obviously see them and they make a dexterity saving throw or they take one da radiant damage so on so a +5 okay so um I think the formula for saving throws is 8 plus whatever your spell-casting modifiers which is 5 so they have to beat a 13 or else they're gonna be sound fire okay 10 plus 2 is 12 so your vet says in the spell description here that the target has to succeed on a dexterity saving throw right that is what they're taking I do all right all right got it they rolled a 12 so they barely miss it so you roll one t8 you will the eight-sided die and that will establish how much damage they take it's the one that doesn't have any numbers higher than eight I rolled a six that is pretty that's very very good see you attack you launch some fire on to the goblin closest to the wagon and with that he looks like upon death's door and the other column that you can see the one that's not in the brush somewhere just sort of stops in his tracks and it's like oh [ __ ] and that is where he's at next in order is Justin blast that one in the brush I'm gonna how far away is the one in the brush Griffin the one out in the brush is about 40 feet out okay now question yeah do I see the one in the brush you actually do not Travis is the one who spotted him oh you can search for the you you know sort of the general direction if you try to cast a spell Adam right now you that disadvantage because you don't exactly know where he is if you want to do a perception check it would take up your term but you could get a pretty good idea of where this person is now I'm gonna blast the the one that Murrell hit okay with a ray of Frost a popular popular scale thank you break off ray of frost ray what's it do it's a frigid beam of blue-white light streaks towards a creature within range you make a range spell attack against the target gotcha your attacks when you make an attack with a spells +5 so you roll you against heresy right so they need a so when I did mine last time I should have added five no that's what your 13 is okay gotcha okay yeah what did you roll juice what do I roll a d20 you roll d 20 and you add four five all right oh that's a 24 holy [ __ ] yeah you uh you blast that thing and you are attacking the one that Merle just hit or the world Merle hasn't barrel just hit yeah at least you put him out he was on fire okay you gotta roll your damage now which is d-a-d eight six you don't have anything to bet it's just right okay you uh you freeze him instantly you flash freeze him and he sort of topples to the ground in shatters yeah so why am I so horny horrible thing if you had talked to them you would have realized that they're part of a hug committee they were running forward to hug you to give you a hug Travis you're up so here's what I'm trying to decide other team members do if you're talking to us you need to talk in character and it needs to be a free action okay so talk to avoid son of a [ __ ] taco Merrill oh don't do I judge now it's tempting okay great should I jump down and smash the other one running towards us or should I well I can't get to him if he's sixty people do they have charge in this game so uh not as a ability where you get to move double your movement in attack you you can - as an action which is basically you get to move again you double your speed essentially but no you can move and do a range attack and you have you've spotted these guys you know where the other one is in the brush so you could ostensibly do that unless I can throw my battle axe I do not have a ranged attack you should you should have oh I guess you rolled your own guys so I don't know yeah I I went for a wooden shield instead of a buckler and didn't take it okay I mean I could you can three shield got him Captain America probably wouldn't go so great well so then that's the question is I feel like I lose I lose should I take out the one closest to us yes okay great I'm gonna jump off the cart and try the kind of so I can swing my battle axe double-handed if I haven't drawn my shield yet off my back okay but can divine that your your armor is going to be lower as a result of that yes okay I have to do that but for right now I'm going to jump off the cart and try to come down on top of him swinging like my battle axe two-handed okay what is that I assume grants me advantage if you do a leaping strike from the wagon down down on to the dome piece of this this court one is what yes that's what I'm trying to do the gorban is probably about 15 to 20 feet away from you he's down right next to the wagon so that's a lot of Magnus has a vertically will they uh I'm gonna make you I'll let you do it but you have to make a very low Athletics check if you're just jumping that's athletics terrific a +5 athlete all right yeah that'll do that'll do Pig great um so you're allowed to make this stupid attack that you're making so during the battle axe two-handed means my damage is one okay and instead of one B but you have to actually roll the attack yes okay I realize and you have advantage so you can roll to D 20 great so I rolled it 20 right there so I'll roll again you rolled a crit no okay it was a 15 plus 5 and then a 9 so I 20 was mine okay yeah that'll do it and I'm gonna roll one to 10 this one yeah so that's 10 plus 3 13 you've rolled max damage yes you cut the thing in half long ways you got the thing in half the nave to the chest in like the direction that if you had your choice you at least like to be cut in half how it says the least survivable having that could possibly be conceived so you guys are moving through this much faster than thought you would [ __ ] so the other goblin that's out in the brush pops up almost like yeah guys get up oh no no God no no he sees wait I thought there only two gore blends out there way there why the three over there oh Jesus Jerry no is horrified and draws a draws a what is he drew chose a short bow and takes an air out of his quiver and seems to fidget with it for a bit and then you see him light the arrow on fire correction of wool same Magnus since you are actually actually who's still on the wagon both of them are throwing a taco on I fell off the wagon B let's say he launches it at taco so he makes a range attack he rolls a 5 plus 5 which is oh sorry plus 4 5 plus 4 is 9 which I assume is not going to do it doesn't do it so Justin that would be against your armor class I'll be against your armor class what is your AC juice 12 yeah so 9 doesn't cut it it's sort of twangs into the side of the canvas of the wagon instead oh no is that setting our is this setting our canvas on fire it has actually begun to set the canvas on fire and it almost seems like he's satisfied with that result and as you guys are distracted by the flames he turns around and starts to hoof it his speed is 30 feet so he gets a pretty good distance into the the brush so he's how far away on the wagon he was 40 feet away when you started your turn and then he moved in a little bit to see how terrible things were and then ran off so I'll say about about 50 feet away and moving into the brush okay how bad is the fire in the canvas not that I remember I mean not bad yet you know historically canvas is a very burnable material all right so so it could get relatively Brown take care of it I got no I got no difference that was his turn and we're back to the order top of the order well I'm going to leave the fire up to somebody else and throw my hand axe you need to you're gonna move in the direction of can I move before I throw ya yeah yeah sure you can you can split your reel up up you can move about however you want you can move 10 feet into a match with 25 feet okay so for a move from the wagon you get about half distance to where he is you are throwing your hand axe into some brush so he's gonna have a partial cover which basically means his AC is going to be improved his armor class is already pretty decent so you need to you need to roll real well what am i rolling so on your paper you knee a little thing in the middle there there should be a hand axe thing and it'll tell you what your mod is so roll a d20 well a d20 you're gonna add okay 14 and I had force that's 18 18 he would have had 17 with that cover so yes you just barely you throw it into the woods you can't exactly see you see like a branches rustling and you throw your axe of that direction in you here so you know you probably connected and got some got some meat in there so roll 1 d6 + 2 and that's your damage yeah well uses six plus two is eight uh after you hear that ah you don't hear anything ever again from that he never makes another sound every which one we quickly put out the fire it is it is so late I was going to use prestidigitation on it okay Justin uses his presidential fat taco taco maybe says a magic word maybe says I have the ability to instantly light or snuff out a candle torch a small campfire so I think that'll work here yes definitely it's not bigger than smoking a fire so do you say some tight [ __ ] with you yes yeah say them say they he certainly does you can't you can't that can't be his you know I want I want I don't think like can you do me a favor and look at I believe it's your other proficiencies in languages section okay and what it says under there I'm looking at his it does in fact say yoki you guys just when your first fight with one kill each yeah you didn't take a lick of damage hey let's search these fools yeah I want to go search him oh I don't know how to do that is there anything on the gobble you're not allowed to search let's search them well one broke into a thousand pieces once had it so he's covered with goo that's a lot of weeds that's probably a non-starter but um don't you think we ought to check on gun Durand and one of them oh [ __ ] one of them actually has a collection of small coins coppers Silver's they have a lot of them though um which he goes out to about 20 gold pieces what you can split up however however you want well for right now under the car just go and hold on to it sure I know I should think the trusted cleric I'm the religious okay how about we each get so I felt like the cleric and I did most of the work there all right let's here's what I suggest we each take six we put the rest into a pool that will split later good idea okay every time one of us dies we'll add five more into X past or the live kitchen will just take Switzer Tontine okay excellent so yeah that's that's what you find on them yeah you guys are great yeah we did um oh wait what what are you doing my dad is stuck to the chair oh okay he unplugged his headphones - what are you doing oh now he's gonna eat my shrimp I'm in half this is the worst game ever we do you tell me I'm done telling you what I want to find out what some of those horses can we please figure out some sort of order to this cuz I write I feel right now we're all just shouting so can we take turns I feel that that Merle may be right and we need to check on the horses and see if we can find any indication that those were gun guns and berry blue jeans yeah the the horses are covered in well not covered they have a few obviously mortal holes you know arrow holes you recognize them as but somebody say any arrows back from a very prudent party um they're not asleep oh by the way can I grab that short bow from that uh dude so I can actually have a range level you can it's not great that's better than what I got not it was great short bow if you want to look at the guide and see how short bows work you can go for that Travis is a good looter you are um also assumed that there was a quiver of arrows you can use make sure that you pay attention to whether or not you're proficient in Erebos I assume you I think fighters are typically pretty good at just well yeah I'm proficient at all marshal and Commonwealth Oh simple weapons these were um that was sort of the crown jewel of the weapons they were using the other two didn't have longbows they basically had shitty swords that aren't with your time do I need to go recover the hand I will just assume that you did okay unless something happens to you we're like you are spirited away somehow before the end of the fight you recover all of your arrows and weapons and stuff like that again that's like another DNZ thing of like I don't want you to have to go in town and be like well off to the arrow store because that's some people that would work I mean people some people do it that way it's just not what I'm into okay so yeah you got these two horses they are they are dead as [ __ ] there are a few empty bags and containers lying around are they cold the horses they are actually a little bit warm this is not a okay this did not happen last night as soon as they left you assume maybe they made camp after leaving the tavern last night and this may have happened within a matter of hours and in fact why don't you guys to make an investigation check if you want and I can tell you what you what you can discern so I'll explain the difference between investigation and perception perception is basically when you can't see something and you're trying to find out if something is there that's perception if you know something's there and you want to know more about it that's investigation I rolled it - I can't find my own bike now you like a look at these big dead dogs I could see it far away I mean I knew nothing about it 17:17 domestic okay morale what do I add to it just the investigation number next to investigation okay so I rolled an 11 okay Merle and Magnus you are sort of clueless you notice the horse Justin among the containers you notice an empty map container maybe a tube that a roll of parchment could be secured inside what you might ship a poster in but fantasy-like which you actually recognize from the tavern last night as something that gun durin did have on him at the at the tavern it's been uncapped uncorked it is empty but you do get to mean that these two horses did belong to two Gunjan and buried now I'm sorry didn't dungeon give us his map no he didn't he didn't give you his is this was a different map this is not a map that that it's a mapping not an app that gets you from Faneuil into Neverwinter that map doesn't consider deserving container that's a shitty map that's a dumb map of a route that anybody should so this may be the map to this lost or mine possibly I think it's playing into my suspicions that he yeah I think yeah he had something else going on I'm a Massa cartographically based shenanigans his waiters do we see anything as far as like any other tries there any indication that they were also killed here um make a perception check looking for I don't know blood or viscera the one three I need you guys I rolled a one a 20 23 23 just from both the 23 um y'all gonna make these checks so much faster dad and Justin are sharing it guys can we just assume that if I got 23 then my a nd okay so so taco you don't see any blood or anything on the ground I mean there is a lot of horse blood and it's really hard to tell I mean obviously it's more beautiful than human blood more perfect silvery silvery but you don't see a lot of like there's not a um a silver shaped pool of blood on the ground God where maybe he was dissolved can I make that observation yeah I think it's wonderful that you continued them a BIM BAM tradition of killing horses I didn't do it this show I didn't do it herb once did it okay so the evil Gaurav oh you don't see any blood or anything but you do notice with your keen perception you do notice a pattern in the dirt that suggests that that they were perhaps dragged into the brush around the area where the one goblin shot his fiery arrow at you and then dad threw an axe into the darkness and stung can can we go back to the brush and explore that again yeah sure it checks now if your hold on it if I'm a bang this raises his hand for a bit I'm not an intelligent man but we've got a cart like packed to the brim with good sitting here should we just be wandering off away from that cart okay well I'll tell you what I'll tell you what Magnus you stay with the cart they're like deal damage superior perception I'll investigate the brush you could also hide your cart in the brush sounds like quite the production no I like my plan now your answer I will also say that splitting up the party is cover it up with some brilliant closet waitress way by you splitting up the party is what it's the leading cause of death in Dungeons &amp; Dragons it is it is a head of heart disease it's I will say that I use my vehicle proficiency to hide yeah sure I'll buy that yeah maybe you take it down the good path a little bit it's a we we bury the goods you let you take it into the the hole in the brush that you can see the drag marks in going through and you sort of park it in the brush in a way that Aqsa it and keep an eye on the cottage fully fully covered from the road so you are you have more or less secured the wagon let's head in the rush headlong oh boy how how are we gonna get out of this one Travis well seems like then McElroy boys are at it again it's stuck in a real pickle trap they're piggles show is trapped hi everybody we're just gonna jump in real quick just to interrupt the adventure super quick well and then we'll get back to it and you're on there or on that you're on edge of your seats okay for the whole seat but you'll only use the edge you actually didn't pay for a seat adult did you free dinner did you not pay for this goddamn podcast again we're gonna just real quick throw money zone at you and then we're gonna get back into the adventure just real quick I mean as long as we are talking about nerd [ __ ] let's talk about programming and coding and stuff well we've been talking a lot all about fantasy but here's a fact mm-hmm coding has become the most desired job skill of 2014 and probably like 2030 every year since like since like computers and probably for the next at least six years before computers become obsolete yeah before we move on to organic processors tree tree tree pewters mmm-hmm here's here's the good news you're not up [ __ ] creek if you don't know anything if you don't know [ __ ] about [ __ ] you need to get on one month one month has a lot of different sort of coding disciplines that you can learn for instance one month HTML is the easiest way available to learn how to code websites and make websites here's how it works it's called one month because it takes one month you spend 30 minutes a day and you will start from scratch knowing nothing and they will shape your mind mold your mind into something that will be capable of shaping and molding a website and from like a first day of class you start building your own website it's like by the end not only do you know how to do it but you've got basically at the beginning of a portfolio to show to other people I as somebody who has started to learn coding like still figuring out how to make a website is not like actually super difficult and it's super rewarding once you once you get it going it's the like then it's all the polishing and refining that's like so gratifying it's it's a it's a really genuinely fun process and you can do it you can do it with one month they have a community of like 12,000 students that you can chat with and help out and be helped by you get hands-on training from from the people at one month they do like video tutorials for you specifically for you and even even if you already know HTML they offer so many other classes they have one

recording this I think it's safe to say I did I don't know if you did Travis well I mean it was all right I guess I had a pretty good time I would like to do it more and the wait if you're enjoying it the way to ensure that we do stuff like this more is to share this episode with all of your friends yeah or just let us know what you thought of it little bit i've i've never really deemed before we're planning like a new version of the game that nobody really knew how to play my like dad had never played it Justin what the head also basically never played it so like I don't know I feel like it was a bit there was a bit of discomfort there for like the first 45 minutes or so that we kind of got over so I don't know I definitely want to do more of it probably as like a separate thing well if you want to cover some more about what you thought about the show you can follow us on Twitter you can do that my brother my brother me Facebook appreciation group will probably make a I'll also make a threat on the max fun forums you can find maximum fun org slash forums I think which is home to all the other wonderful maximum fun or podcast which you should check out we don't have time to go into now but they're incredible they are really great so yeah it will give us any feedback you you may have on like how this could be like a better thing or like a thing that we could do more permanently or how I can up my my DM game we've gotten some suggestions from people even before we put this out like getting guest players and getting like I do this is like a cool idea like getting like Twitter submissions for things to actually put in the adventure which I think would actually be super super sweet really I think we just want an excuse to play more Dungeons &amp; Dragons with each other because yes I like it a lot so anyway just just give us whatever feedback you might have even if that feedback is I didn't like it please don't do any more of this it smells like but please don't please stop you're all very bad at Dungeons &amp; Dragons I mean keep that [ __ ] to like a minimum if you can just because I am pretty sensitive but otherwise thank you all for for listening next week I think we're gonna put up the Los Angeles live show which was phenomenal I don't want to toot our own horn but it's like my favorite live show we've ever done the audio quality is very good which is going to be a refreshing change of pace for everybody and then I don't know it depends on where Justin's at he's in paternity leave right now so hopefully we can get him back in here to record something but if not we'll get something up we will we're not gonna interrupt the flow as it were so thank you all for listening and now enjoy the rest of our maiden voyage so you follow these drag marks down the trail and they're pretty easily followed gendron's kind of a big guy for a dwarf he's big in in terms of diameter so the his trail left a definite impression in the loam to the mouth of a cave that a sort of natural stream is flowing out of pretty wide stream not especially deep but it's the most goddamn beautiful thing you've ever seen hmm it is all of you get 20 points of inspiration just from seeing what you are you are deeply inspired no you don't get that um it's the mouth of a cave a long sort of the stream you can sort of see into the cave little ways you can see basically the cave is comprised of a path along the the right side of the of the mouth of the cave that leads in along side of the stream basically running perpendicular into the cave can we see maybe about 20 feet one of you will probably have to light a torch this might actually be a good chance for maybe a light causing spell yeah wizard you got something I have light I mean oh there it is I mean you got it now two of three of us can see in the dark though right that is true I cannot but I do have a candle that's not going to be especially luminous okay that's not gonna do a great job but Dad you can cast light for free since it's a can trip on to maybe a nice stick that you found on the ground and and give that to a fighter who can't see super sugar great in the under earth is Travis your weapon one-handed or two-handed uh it is either it is versatile okay so you I could give you a torch and still be able to use your weapon you can also just cast light on my axe that might look bitchin alright let's go with the bitching effect of Cassie why don't Iraq okay Travis now has this hole no it's fine oh no you're not attacking his axe you bastard I hate you axe Travis attacking the darkness he is attacking the darkness is it Travis do not have this axe that you can use to see by dad at will Merle you can turn it off just by clapping or by not believing anymore in your magic get all up it's very mad yeah so so keep that in mind Magnus can now see pretty easily so can the two of you but Merle you have dark vision as well I have dark vision 60 foot radius okay see you guys yeah you don't really need light you can maybe see a little bit further if you had a torch but 60 feet at this cave it's not gonna get much wider than 60 feet at any point I'll leave the way with the light okay you are leading the way not too far into the cavern you feel the path branch off to the right I guess you see it because you have this beautiful light axe and in fact as you sort of get within distance of that entrance that the light of your axe from your the light from your bitching axe pours into it you hear wrestling in there you hear the sound of metal sort of clinking together almost like a chain being being moved lifted off the ground uh-huh so it sound like a happy chain or a scary chain chains aren't typically these are in our magic chains that are imbued with emotions okay so it's up to you how you want to handle this I guess let me put the right yeah it sounds like a big chain or like just a regular human yeah the passage goes on ahead of you but there's basically a natural sub cavern sort of splitting off to the right there that you have not really moved in front of but you can hear the sounds of wrestling and in Chains but not like a lot of change does sound like a it's not like there's a WWE backyard wrestling match happening there but was then like an I guess Marley Magnus believes that thing is for other people and I tend towards action so I'm going down that chain hallway I like that I am actually going to give you a point of inspiration for that so I head down the hallway towards the chains okay did do the two of you follow him or are you more chakra chills I think there's a chance that maybe still darn Gunder and trained up down there oh listen that okay so I'm going to help you head in Merl what's what's your position on you fool wait for us to shop you shout loudly down the cave it bounces down the halls of the cave and you don't hearing you respond how they get food oh well they definitely know it bats pouring out they have gas bat that's that's that's baseball bats do the bats have gas they definitely do yeah check to see if the bats look gassy okay I guess I follow them okay well Charlie there's no basically tacos on team hangout well I only go by 25 feet like I'm not gonna get too far away well no we're not going we're not in combat so you there's no order so okay well I don't want to get too far away from them listen I'm foolhardy but I'm not stupid yeah you know I'm gonna go down the hall you know the 60 feet that they can still see me and I can still see back okay you space yourself out a little bit and you just sort of turn the corner into this cavern and sort of wave your axe around hoping to cast some light on the things that you see in there inside you see a decent sized cavern no furniture no furnishings to speak of whatsoever there are still lag stalactite so which is the one that comes up out of the ground just like my mites are you sure about that still act like those swords the black tights are stalactites are from the ceiling you see some bitching that's receiving bitching combs of rock pointy rock things built into the the earth and coming out of them are these big metal rods connected to chains connected to wolves three wolves kill the light kill the light you're light um you can but I have to say if the natural sounds you're making it as you're moving down the cavern didn't disturb them the shout of hey you be more careful definitely definitely woke them up but they're not they're not like growling they're not uh they don't seem especially violent right now I actually have animal handling skill pretty good of course you do I do my my folk hero nature I'm a farmer carpenter what's your animal handling what is your animal handle plus three okay yeah so is mine okay well [ __ ] you every father wants to hear that from his son I'm gonna I'm gonna have his father right now are you yours adventuring companion oh that's right I am going to cautiously but confidently approach the wolves if anything is more important what you're dealing with wolves you got to be confident cuz they can smell that I don't want to appear weak because they're the the predator prey behavior is gonna kick in okay how's that I know about animals with every passing step that you draw closer to them they seem more agitated a couple of them are snarling at you now they are but there's nothing else in the room other than these wolves um make a perception check 20 a 20 you notice actually in the back of the room you see a crevice almost perfectly in the back of the room across from the entrance that leads upwards almost like a natural chimney kind of built into the built into the cave there that leads up to another chamber it's very very very tight quarters it's about 25 feet up it's straight up there like we wouldn't be able to shimmy up it it is straight up I mean you might be able to spider climb your way up there but it would be very very difficult but that feeling is so the wolves and this crevice or the thin man crevice yeah okay so I'm gonna back back away because Travis always go first cuz I rushed her in the room said he wanted to alright fine I listen that's gonna be great every time but once and then you're gonna need a new brother look I'm still chilling out here if anyone's curious okay um Magnus you thought do you have illusion hmm do you have something that you can you you can't ask me that I'm not in there with you he's right all right your crime I'm tired of plate I want to play Dungeons and Dragons I'm tired of asking questions about dungeon area it's great I'm gonna head back so there's some wolves down there doesn't seem like it's worth it let's keep going excellent well I trust your judgment okay I mean we go I'm into that yeah sure all right so you can continue down the cave it's getting very dark basically the natural light that was coming in from the mouth of the cave is is it was providing quite a bit so you can see until now basically and now you need your your light axe your mag light to really get around Merle and taco I almost forgot your name impossibly um you are you don't need it you don't you can see basically just find out here um so as you are moving down the cave alongside this this stream you notice across the stream to the left is a is another passageway but this one is just like covered in rubble it seems like it's collapsed down down aways and make also a perception check looking down the length of the cavern the in the direction you're moving you have nine for me twelve fourteen a fourteen okay mmm-hmm Merle you actually see up ahead the outline of a overhead bridge an overpass that is that is suspended in the air it's connected to two entrances on the second story level it looks like it's connecting two passageways higher up in the cave a second story of this cave oh you know I bet that that that shimmying up chimney thing would have really helped us here probably put us on that second level maybe you also see the outline of a figure sitting on top of the bridge I'll call out to him hello friend you using common I'm assuming to do that no elvish oh just in case there's some underground elves you hear a questioning ground like huh and then I try get in no shhh I tried getting Goblin get it Goblin you don't know goblins so you kind of yes I do it's one of my languages is it real I'm an Elvis draconic dwarvish and goblin okay what do you yell hello friend who's there hail it a little bit I you don't sound like anybody I know we're just exploring we've taken a wrong turn you certainly have I would actually heartily recommend you turn around this is not a great place for tourism he does not know how to handle that situation come on bit closer show yourself to me come closer come closer to the overpass this is a good time if you've gotten the illusion magic I will warn you we're very dangerous though we mean you no harm I would not suggest launching an attack on us how dangerous are you how dangerous you're talking yeah excellently well played I was just trying to establish a rapport not to be fair to be fair Merle doesn't speak goblin and neither do I okay it's a do you have gold sorry you'll all right where are we you're in art you're in our hideout you were making me extremely uncomfortable I don't know who you are what you're doing new recruits but like I'd seen you is certainly my doctor my name is taco a friend of ours was taken and his horses were killed where Sir oh [ __ ] yeah we did that hey guys someone's here guys it's the guys from the horse thing Jews made use made to him off I need a how close am i Griffin uh you are you managed to get about 20 feet in there but as he yells he readies his weapons so go ahead and roll initiative push them off the thing with your mage hands like oh my god how'd you get seventeen dad you got a Merle got a four or got a team okay I got it Merle got a tan and taco got a four or a Ikes is that with your modifiers yes we're just given gonna give you the numbers the modifiers from now on yeah I got 17 oh jesus okay that's very good that's a two plus two equals four okay um so you have this one goblin on the overpass and after his word of warning nobody's really rushed to his aid either by the two entrances the overpass connects or from the depths of the cave that you're facing you do hear in the distance down the the length of the cave an extremely loud racket you hear voices saying something taco you can understand as one of them says two voices talking you here once a Rayleigh and the other says you are them and then you hear a banging almost like somebody's hitting something against something else you can't exactly unless you see it you can't really tell what the what the noise is but you hear a pretty terrible sound coming from down there on top of the order is Magnus so I am gonna hole up in that and they're coming from behind us they are coming from nobody's coming you can't really determine the voices you heard are actually coming from them in front of you behind the overpass the overpass is in front of you behind that is is deeper okay great I'm gonna post up and move to in front of that overp at the entrance and the overpass no we're already in action where you were you moving underneath the bridge I'm moving to the opening wherever it is the voices are coming from I want to be ready for whoever's come okay so you sort of position yourself in front of you move under the underpass to the other side waiting for whatever's coming down yeah and I'm gonna ready an attack action before what if something first person to come down my hallway you're just gonna mail a tech yeah okay so and by the way I've got my shield and my nyah okay so to explain you can ready in action as an action you basically to say what you're going to do and what's gonna trigger it so maybe you're not in a good position to do something right now but you will be if somebody moves closer to you you can ready that action and then use it basically as soon as the trigger pops so you post up there next in the order is Merle I'm gonna cast shield of faith okay around around Magnus okay can you explain what that does shield of faith shimmering field appears and surrounds creature of your choice within range running at a plus two bonus to AC for the duration okay baller and you're gonna move or do anything out that I guess that's reaction that was one action okay so Travis you have plus two day see ya and dad I think you just expended one of your spell slots yeah okay cool then the order moves to the Goblin on the overpass he sees you put a magic beautiful shield around this already heavily shielded fighter in the front so he sort of turns his attention off of Magnus he's pretty sure he can't penetrate all that and he's actually going to aim at Merle with a short bow and he rolls a oh Jesus a 21 versus AC what's your armor class well 18 18 so 21 beats you're 18 so he needs you four okay four plus two so six piercing damage okay what does that come off though you are your hit you have 11 you have hit two points he is down to five you are down to five okay that's it for him nobody else really shows up in that round it's on to taco I'm going to cast ray of frost on that fool I got one I got one on the breakaway on the overpass the overpass got one okay 2424 that is a hit that's just to make sure where am i get ya okay you know I'm sorry are you sure it's not just a a saving throw just like it is when dad use one help some range attacks some range spells are arranged attacks some are saving think of it like if it's coming down on like an area they make a saving throw to get out of the way of it if it's something that is firing sort of like a arrow then it's a range attack gotcha so Justin hit him right yeah you got a real demon coming up we got eight damn nice eight damage he takes all of that it sort of knocks him back a little bit but he maintains his footing on the overpass he looks like he's about to kick it he looks real bad so that is the end of the round from the back of the hallway that Travis just ran up very valiantly to defend you here almost like something it's just fallen over and then immediately after that you hear the the tell-tale sound of rushing water it's okay it is uh it is back to Magnus the heavily shielded very very brave fighter I'm suddenly very worried about the wolves in the bag they're going to drown that passageway actually goes up so don't worry about those well whew I wouldn't worry more about your self your body gotcha well it seems pretty limited in what I can do so the stream next to you has also when that happened just sort of picked up a little bit sort of got kind of fast I'm gonna step to the side to what I so what we're looking at here is kind of an opening underneath the bridge and that's what I'm standing in front of correct you're basically a little bit in front of being under the overpass that's about ten feet up great I'm gonna head back okay so where my buddy's is and then I'm gonna shoot the little goblin with my short bow um okay unless there's something else I can do no you're just gonna sort of stand there yeah 23:23 that is a hit okay great and then d6 +35 you hit him square in the chest and he says why you guys weren't kiddin and then he falls off the the bridge limply into the strips that's the same one that I had been attacking yep yes yeah it was the it was the only one kudos all around high five so there are number monsters but we are still in initiative order we will move on now to Merle do we have are you saying we no longer have access to the the chamber of the head the Wolves in it that chamber was back aways you couldn't die back there then I say we need to cross the oh I'm gonna cross the overpass okay you you aren't on level with it it's about 10 feet up oh I see so in the oh okay so it does not come to our level and then overpass I gotcha gotcha well obviously we need to move forward and get out of the way of the water forward is the direction the water's coming from it does there seem to be any way to get up to the overpass level I mean you can climb well then let's climb well you are already acted American I will climb high will climb what do I need to do you will make when they try to climb up to the overpass okay to climb you make a an athletics check to basically scale up the wall you're not climbing that high and there is like a rack rocky craggy surface so okay it's not an especially difficult check actually to get up there the bridge is relatively rickety it's a goblin construction so it's not amazing but it looks like it'll hold your weight okay so I roll the 20-sided dice you roll a 20-sided die and you had your your athletics alright I rolled a three so my athletics is four that makes it seven that is not sufficient you start to climb up the rocks they're a little bit wet from the moisture in here you slip off you don't take any damage because you're probably only a few feet up and you're not a very tall person so I mean that is a significant distance but you do land on your ass and you're embarrassed you take ten embarrassment points it ends like it's and I uh peed a little okay you peed a little bit you might be advanced in years maybe you pee a little bit every time you take any damage I don't remember saying anything about my age all right taco hurry we got to do this huh it's on Meryl yeah Meryl don't forget to you look damaged if you have some sort of way of healing yourself be sure to don't gosh floor that you're injured I will attempt the same climb that felled my friend Murr okay I have no athletic c10 14:14 that were doing you uh lucky first time was first time is luck huh you scurry up the up the rocks and you you managed to climb on top of this bridge if you feel it sway and shake a little bit underneath you as you get up there but it holds fast that is the end of the round suddenly a horrifying wave of water a wall of water comes hurtling down the cave and basically blasts into our heroes that are on the ground level first it hits Magnus and then shortly thereafter collides with Merle who is still on his ass it starts to sweep you away however you you both are sort of close to the craggy cave wall so you can make a dexterity saving throw to try and not get flushed by this this wall of water that's rushing at you so basically you're going to roll a d20 and add your dexterity modifier to it and you want to beat a target that I'm not gonna tell you I got a 13 you got 13 total tomorrow yeah I got a 16 okay so both have you managed to grab on to the wall at just as this wave of water hits you and tries to pull you away unsuccessfully there was a lot of water though so you are sort of having to fight against the stream holding on to these rocks so I need you both to also make a strength saving throw to make sure that you can hold on to this rock the whole time talking or just sort of watching this this charade take place from here safe playing out there you're not laughing but you are amused to see how it goes I got I got it I got seven both of you get flushed oh no torrent the water you weren't really like hit by the wave of force that this thing brought with it at first but you are dragged down the cave back into sort of the first antechamber go ahead and take one D for both of you as you're a sort of pachinko to round the rocks way even with my special shield the one who do want oh well the water wasn't attacking you as much as soon as ya break you know again spreads out of three you got a three out of three as well okay so you both take three damage time down to two and that is the end I'm fine don't worry about me don't worry about taco so that was the end that was the end you're out of combat that's the end you actually hear taco from down the cavern in Goblin you are primed to hear this taco the other two are sort of too far away and also they don't speak goblin so they wouldn't hear it but you hear did we get them answering goblin taco no let me try kid yes which one does it make up your mind no we definitely go oh thank god should we come down there or is it is it cool no is it no do the drown bodies look kind of cool helmets tyler's water everywhere I agree I got two Hardy from the killing and I Jesus not again we're actually gonna Sam here private ah you uh you hear them shuffle off you hear the sound of footsteps moving away from you and you think that using your clever ruse you have scared them off yes ruse you
