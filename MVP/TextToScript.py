    You are given a segment of a Dungeons & Dragons session transcript:

    Session Content:
    {content}

    Your task is to transform this into a comic book script, broken down into individual panels.

    Each panel must include:
    - A detailed visual description suitable for image generation (key: "panel art")
    - A line of dialogue or narration (key: "text")

    Instructions:
    - Structure the output as a JSON array of objects.
    - Each object must contain exactly two keys:
    - "panel art": A vivid, standalone description of the panel art. Include setting, characters, action, and mood.
    - "text": A single line of spoken dialogue or narration. Rephrase as a proper sentence if needed, but keep the meaning true to the original session.
    - Process the entire input and split it into as many panels as necessary.
    - Do **not** include any additional explanation, commentary, or text outside of the JSON array.

    Output only a valid JSON array. Example format:

    [
    {{
        "panel art": "A dimly lit tavern filled with laughing patrons. Magnus, a red-bearded human, clinks mugs with Taco and Merle at a wooden table.",
        "text": "So our story begins with the three of you sitting at this tavern."
    }},
    {{
        "panel art": "Close-up of Magnus, his face lit by candlelight, a sheepish grin on his face.",
        "text": "Nobody wants chairs anymore. Everyoneâ€™s into wrought iron now."
    }}
